# CryptopiaTradingFramework


I've written and shared three major cryptocurrency robots: Slingshot, Razer, and my best- Volatronix for Cryptopia.  I cannot share the code for my trading logic, but this framework might help others build 

If you are interested in using my bots:

Volatronix: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wj3lNNjshEnT7JgCU_FqNS6-qUtYolOjJTh5HFc5-Z8/edit?usp=sharing

Razer: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vciw4EiZ739j_-33_aU8OFF7tXiAwMu3gcM82Hw4CpA/edit?usp=sharing

Slingshot: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17I2pddC4h3P4tPVAmhNQEgvjx22CY_35cVVetu0hwT8/edit?usp=sharing

And our community of users, actually quite large now! Doing good work here: https://discord.gg/s7pAag6
At our Discord chatroom we have lots of people who can help you get set up if i'm not around, or people to talk about settings, or share trade histories, etc.  

My work is legit, and people are earning Crypto every day

*** I no longer distribute python .exe files for trading.  they are too easy to decompile.  If you are interested in trading the ultimate volatronix strategy, go here, running serverside: https://triphiusfire.nz/volatronix.html  ***
