# CryptopiaTradingFramework

You can see the framework I wrote nearly all of (everything except the api query function itself) to build my trading robots in the "Slingshot" series, and "Liquidate".

You can read about, freely download and use my systems by following the documentation links found at https://triphiusfire.carrd.co/

Slingshot Flex, Slingshot Ultimate, and Liquidate are robots you can use to earn bitcoin or liquidate alt-coins to bitcoin on the exchange, also listed in the website above.
